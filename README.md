# Animal-Guess-Tree

This project was an exercise in Binary and Decision Trees. The goal of the project was to create an Akinator-like oracle that figures out the animal the user is guessing. The oracle asks questions and stores users' answers into the Decision Tree, so that eventually the tree will print the correct animal. 

There are two files giving an example of how this works. Each 'Y' means the user answered yes, and each 'N' means the user answered no. Every yes or no response is a path down the Decision Tree. 

This project also explores the use of file writers such as Buffered Writer. 

There is given starter code in the files BinaryTree.java written by Professor Nicholas Howe of Smith College.
